# Rancid Tomatillos

## Description

Rancid Tomatillos is a React app that uses Redux as a global state management tool.
In creating this app, our team focused on the following:
* Designing architecture of React application, including class and functional components and using Redux to manage global state
* Using React Router to navigate from page to page
* Using various endpoints to fetch, post and delete data
* Resolving promises and cleaning data
* Test Driven Development, including testing asynchronous methods and Redux methods

## Installation

To access this repo, simply clone down and run `npm install` to access the necessary packages.  For the best viewing experience, run `npm run start` and copy and paste your local server into the browser.

This app is also deployed on Heroku and can be [found here](http://cherokeesteak31.herokuapp.com/)

## User Interface and User Experience
### Landing Page
![Landing page when the user loads the app](https://imgur.com/r8PHdRA.png)

The user will see a series of movies that they can then click on to view more information.

### Movie Page



## Login 


When the user clicks on "View Characters" from the specific Movie Component, they will be routed to a specific page for that movie that includes all of the characters for that movie.  There is still a Header component at the top of the page, the scrolling text from the beginning of the specific movie they're viewing, and Character components, each one being a character from that specific movie.

## Future Iterations 
Future iterations of this project will include the following:
* Responsiveness for mobile phones
* Refactor the Loading Component to be dependent on state
* Build Error Component if there is an error fetching the data from the Star Wars Api
* Include movie and character-specific images on each card that's rendered
